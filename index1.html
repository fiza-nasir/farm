            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>
                Jeremy Hayes formed Hayes Farms in 2009. With years of experience in the growing industry and degrees 
                in horticulture and agriculture from the University of Florida, Jeremy sought to offer the highest-quality 
                Christmas trees at great prices. Originally serving the Parkland area, Hayes Farms has expanded to include 
                multiple locations and online sales. All the trees are individually inspected before being sent south from farms in North Carolina and Tennessee. 
                This ensures a healthy, high-quality tree for your home.
